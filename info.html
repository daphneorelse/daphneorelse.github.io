            rmory is dedicated to creating dangerously powerful software for your music &amp; audio production. 
            It's all inspired by the sound, look, and feel of <b>weapons</b>â€”everything from nuclear detonators to chainsaws, from horror movies to real life.
            Bold, violent music and stylish interfaces are what's on the menu.

                Armory is just me, Daphne &#58;&#41;

            <p>
                I became obsessed with music software when I was 15, and ten years later my obsession is only growing.
                I studied at CCRMA <span style="font-size: 11px"><i>&#40;Center for Computer Reasearch in Music &amp; Acoustics&#41;</i></span> at Stanford and earned my BS in Human Computer Interaction from the Computer Science department.
                I love making the software, and I love using it for my own music even more.
            </p>
            <p>
                
                A core belief of mine is that the look and feel of software influences our music more than we even know.
                Much of my efforts is dedicated to the storytelling of my tools, which I hope inspires users to try things in their music that might scare them.
                Actually, I <span class="skew-17 inline-block">hope</span> it scares them.
